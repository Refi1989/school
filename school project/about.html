        <h2>About us</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Reformed Primary is an independent school in Midrand, Johannesburg,
             that provides high-quality education to learners from Grade R to Grade 3 with higher grades phasing in annually.
              With small class sizes, dedicated teachers, and an enhanced curriculum, we empower learners with 21st-century skills and knowledge to grow into high-performing, 
              self-confident individuals who are ready to become the leaders of the future.

              we offer two different phases in this school which is foundation phase and Intermediate phase.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>Foundation Phase: Grade R to Grade 3</h2>
              <br>
              With dedicated teachers and small class sizes, our foundation phase starts by providing the emotional and intellectual foundation required to handle the formal learning that starts in Grade 1.
               We then gradually develop learnersâ€™ skills and knowledge in basic areas such as language (comprehension, speaking, and listening), mathematics (counting and understanding numbers),
                and creative problem-solving in an environment where they enjoy coming to school. 
                Through our enhanced curriculum, learners are introduced to project-based learning and they gain 21st-century skills through subjects such as Robotics and having isiZulu as an additional language option.
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2>Intermediate Phase: Grade 4 to Grade 7</h2>
                <br>
                In these grades, learners are led into more abstract thought and independent work.
                 Our small class sizes and dedicated teachers prepare them for high school by teaching them how to apply the 21st-century skills and concepts they have learned.
                  As a Reformed School, we also promote creativity and critical thinking by encouraging children to make their own choices within well-established boundaries.
                   Our enhanced curriculum includes specialised subjects such as Robotics and learners from this phase onwards may use tablets in class to enhance their learning experience.
